Introduction

The user experience (UX) design process revolves around multiple rounds or iterative cycles of design creation, testing, and modification. As you progress through this process, your design models will increase in fidelity until you have a mockup or prototype that is ready to be handed off to a software developer. It is important to remember that while managing project timelines, expectations, and deliverables helps you meet business needs, it is your application of UX design tools and principles that will enable you to create an intuitive, accessible design that will please and engage your users.


As you work through the UX design process in this task, you will create a wireframe and prototype that can be added to your professional portfolio. Understanding the UX design process will help you as a software developer to build applications that will delight the user.


Refer to the scenario and the “Survey Results” and “About the Island” supporting documents to create a timeline, persona, wireframe, and prototype for the project in the scenario. Your wireframe and prototypes will be evaluated based on your application of UX design principles rather than on their visual merits. This means that your designs do not need to appear professional or finalized, nor do you need to use specialized tools to create them. If you choose to use a template to aid you in creating your design artifacts, you will likely need to modify your template to meet the requirements of this assessment. Refer to the requirements and rubric to ensure your submission will reflect your competency in UX design.


Note: The file size limit for your entire submission cannot exceed 200 MB. Each individual file cannot be larger than 16 MB.
Scenario

You have been contacted by the local government of the small island of Taniti. Since the island’s economy relies heavily on tourism, the Tanitian government has developed a plan to increase the number of tourists who visit the island and its attractions. As part of this plan, they have hired you to design a tourism website.


The Tanitian government has conducted a survey to gather information about current tourists. Their findings from this survey are shown in the “Survey Results” supporting document. The government has also provided you with the attached “About the Island” document to better inform you about Taniti and its visitors.


Taniti’s current website has an outdated look and feel. The page navigation is unclear. All the tourist information is jumbled together on a single page, and the site lacks booking information and links to each activity or option. The site is also not compatible with mobile devices.


The Tanitian government would like you to spend no more than one month designing a new website that will increase tourism on the island of Taniti and provide a welcoming experience for prospective tourists.
Requirements

Your submission must be your original work. No more than a combined total of 30% of the submission and no more than a 10% match to any one individual source can be directly quoted or closely paraphrased from sources, even if cited correctly. The similarity report that is provided when you submit your task can be used as a guide.


You must use the rubric to direct the creation of your submission because it provides detailed criteria that will be used to evaluate your work. Each requirement below may be evaluated by more than one rubric aspect. The rubric aspect titles may contain hyperlinks to relevant portions of the course.


Tasks may not be submitted as cloud links, such as links to Google Docs, Google Slides, OneDrive, etc., unless specified in the task requirements. All other submissions must be file types that are uploaded and submitted as attachments (e.g., .docx, .pdf, .ppt).


A.  Create a timeline of the UX design activities that will take place during this project.


Note: Your timeline does not need to reflect the exact amount of time you will spend on each activity. You may use any tool to create your timeline, including word processing software, a spreadsheet, project management software, presentation software, or another tool of your choice.


Note: The file size limit for your timeline cannot be more than 16 MB. Files larger than 16 MB will not be accepted.


B.  Create a persona profile based on the attached “Survey Results” and “About the Island” supporting documents.


C.  Create a low-fidelity wireframe showing the suggested flow of your new design for the Tanitian website.


Note: You can use any tool to create the wireframe, such as graphic creation/manipulation software, presentation software, word processing software, or another tool of your choice.


D.  Conduct guerrilla usability testing with at least three user testers and then do the following:

1.  Summarize the qualitative feedback you received, specifying which feedback is or is not actionable and relevant to your design.

2.  Explain how you will incorporate the feedback you received to improve your design.


E.  Create an interactive prototype for the Tanitian website that reflects your wireframe design and incorporates the feedback you received during guerrilla testing. Your prototype must be submitted as a URL link.


Note: You can use any tool to create your prototype, such as webpage creation software, GUI editors, or other web development API (e.g., InVision).


F.  List five objective usability tasks you want users to test in Task 2 for your prototype.


G. Acknowledge sources, using APA-formatted in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.


H. Demonstrate professional communication in the content and presentation of your submission.
